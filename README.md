# Customer-Billing-System-
Customer Billing System Project is a simple console application designed to demonstrate the practical use of C programming language.
You can use this application to keep the records such as name, address, mobile number, paid amount, due amount, payment date etc. of your regular costumer. Moreover, if you have a new customer, you can add and edit the account at any time.
Although graphics has not been used in this project, the application of user defined functions and structures have been effectively used here.
